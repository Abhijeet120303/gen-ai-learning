# Plot scatter graph
# Visualize the data
# A scatter plot is a graph that shows the relationship between two variables
# The x-axis represents one variable, and the y-axis represents the other
# Each point on the graph represents a single observation
# Scatter plots are used to see if there is a relationship between two variables
# Scatter plots are used to see if there is a correlation between two variables
# Scatter plots are used to see if there is a pattern between two variables
# Scatter plots are used to see if there is a trend between two variables

# Find correlation (Relation is stron ok)
# Correlation is a normalized form of covariance
# It is a measure of how much two variables change together
# Correlation ranges from -1 to 1
# 1 means that the variables are perfectly correlated
# 0 means that the variables are not correlated
# -1 means that the variables are perfectly inversely correlated

print("Corelation between Experience and Salary is: ",corelation)

# Find covariance (Find is there any relation between two variables)
# Covariance is a measure of how much two variables change together
# Positive covariance means that the variables are directly proportional
# Negative covariance means that the variables are inversely proportional
# Zero covariance means that the variables are not related
# Covariance can be any value
# Covariance is not normalized,standardized,bounded,percentage,probability,correlation
## Covariance of x and y = Î£((x - mean(x)) * (y - mean(y))) / (n-1)
## Covariance of x = Covariance of y
##[[cov(x,y)]] = cov(x,x) = cov(y,y)

# Mean is the average of all values
# Median is the middle value when all values are sorted
